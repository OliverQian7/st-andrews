This is a simple example for how to write some valid JSON. 
Of course, you will need to modify it to output your own data.

On a lab machine, copy these files to a new directory then start 
a terminal and enter the new directory. Then Execute the following:


export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:./javax.json-1.0.jar
javac SimpleJSONWriter
java SimpleJSONWriter


Then look at the file simpleoutput.json
