/**
 * This example shows how a thrown exception is passed back to the calling method, and
 * to the method that called that one, and so on until a catch clause is found or the main
 * method is reached.
 * 
 * Here getId() throws an exception since it is given an unknown customer name. The exception
 * is passed back to the calling method, getAccountBalanceByName(). Since that method doesn't
 * handle the exception, the exception is passed further back to the previous calling method,
 * main(). Here a catch clause is found and so the exception is handled.
